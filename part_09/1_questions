1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?
   Byte Stream is 8 bites
   Char is 16 bites

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?
    FileInputStream
    FilterInputStream
    BufferInputStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?
    FIleReader
    FileWriter
    FilterWriter

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?
    It's give the developer the hability to start a input stream and close it as weel

5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:
    try (FileInputStream fileInputStream = new FileInputStream("/Users/saulot/Desktop/CNTahoe/TestExercises/inputTest.txt")){
                while(fileInputStream.available() >0){
                    System.out.print((char)fileInputStream.read());
                }
            }catch (IOException exp){
                System.out.println(exp.getMessage());
            }

6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?
    char by char

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)
    /**
         * Reads a byte of data from this input stream. This method blocks
         * if no input is yet available.
         *
         * @return     the next byte of data, or <code>-1</code> if the end of the
         *             file is reached.
         * @exception  IOException  if an I/O error occurs.
         */

8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?
    Bytes

9) What is a BufferedReader?
    consolidate the chars

10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?
    because it need to consolidate something

11) What does the InputStreamReader dp with it's byte stream argument?
    concoslidate in words and lines
    ???

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?
    char by char ... line by line
    ??

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"
    FileReader fileInputStream = new FileReader("yucatan_cenotes.txt";
                 BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(fileInputStream);
